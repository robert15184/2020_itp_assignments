    "\n",

    "    + assert <conditional_expression>, <error_message_to_print>\n",

    "In the assignments, assert statements are used to define test cases that check whether your solution is correct or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Question 2 of this assignment, the first assert statement checks whether the `result_addition` variable is equal to the sum of the two numbers that were input.\n",
    "If `results_addition` does not equal `number1 + number2` then an `AssertionError` will be thrown with the message showing the values for result_addition, number1, and number2 in expression form.\n",
